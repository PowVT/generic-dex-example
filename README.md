# Decentralized Exchange using Liquidity Pools

> Built on top of [scaffold-eth](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/scaffold-eth/)

## Quick Hints 
 - Liquidity pools (LPs) are balance on a 1:1 value ratio. The protocol which uniswap uses.
 - Go to the contracts folder and deploy a random ERC20 that will be in a liquidity pool with the native token. 
 - This application is setup on the Kovan testnet, in order to have a sandbox for various research and development. 
 - By providing liquidity, the slippage in the pool should change. Mess around with adding and withdrawing liquidity. 
 - Try depositing liquidity to either side of the pool and you will see how the 'price' changes.
